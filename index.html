    <h2 style = "text-allign:center;"> a tiny bit about me </h2>
      <p> My name is Manvi, I'm a high school student in Washington state.
        I am currently participating in the Summer Immersion Program
        run by Girls Who Code, at a Microsoft campus in Redmond. </p>
  <h3 style = "text-allign:right;"> more things I like </h3>
      <p> Art is a pretty big part of my life. I definitely don't know what I'm doing with my art journal most of the time,
        but that's part of the reason I love art - it can be as free form and spontaneous as you want it. I get a lot of inspiration
        from
      <a href = "http://theinspirationgrid.com/category/art/"> here. </a>
      My mom is a professional photographer so I look at her work for inspiration too (yeah this is a casual unappologetic promotion because my mom is amazing).

          <p> <i> In the first week of this program, we worked
            with a partner to design a side-scrolling game using Scratch.
            My partner and I chanelled our support and passion for womens rights
            into this game, with the aim of educating and empowering players. You can play it

                 <h5> reflection 7/10 </h5>
        <p> To make my website accessible to as many users as possible, I am (planning to) include alternative text descriptions for all of my images. 
          I will also reduce the amount of links users have to follow to get to different parts of the page, so that people with limited mobility have
          a simpler time navigating my website. 
          People have been doing some small things to their code to change the design and overall look of their page in a really awesome way. I have seen 
          a lot of creative uses of fonts, text colors, background colors, and text allignments which I will look into incorporating with my own website. 
          This is the first time I am working with HTML from scratch. I usually just edit websites that already have a basic framework. I feel proud that I 
          am finally learning how to create something entirely new. </p>
