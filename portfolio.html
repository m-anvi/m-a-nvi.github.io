    <h2 style = "text-allign:center;"> a tiny bit about me </h2>
      <p> My name is Manvi, I'm a high school student in Washington state.
        I am currently participating in the Summer Immersion Program
        run by Girls Who Code, at a Microsoft campus in Redmond. </p>
    <h3 style = "text-allign:right;"> more things I like </h3>
      <p> Art is a pretty big part of my life. I definitely don't know what I'm doing with my art journal most of the time,
        but that's part of the reason I love art - it can be as free form and spontaneous as you want it. I get a lot of inspiration
        from
      <a href = "http://theinspirationgrid.com/category/art/"> here. </a>
      My mom is a professional photographer so I look at her work for inspiration too (yeah this is a casual unappologetic promotion because my mom is amazing).

          <p> <i> In the first week of this program, we worked
            with a partner to design a side-scrolling game using Scratch.
            My partner and I chanelled our support and passion for womens rights
            into this game, with the aim of educating and empowering players. You can play it
