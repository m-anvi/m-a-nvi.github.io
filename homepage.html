      <h3>Manvi Saxena</h3>
      <p> <i> <b>Hello!</b></i><br> I am a high school senior at Issaquah High School in Washington state. My current plan is to attend a four-year university and eventually pursue a doctorate degree.
        As a student, I seek every possible opportunity to expand my knowledge on astronomy, neuroscience, and scientific research methods and advocacy.
        In college I plan to study cognitive science. I hope to contribute to the advancement of science by ultimately becoming an astronaut. It soudns like a childhood dream, and
        it is in a way, but going to space is a genuine professional goal that I take very seriously.<br><br><br>
        <b>Why cognitive science?</b><br>
        Following my undergraduate studies, I aim to attend graduate school and achieve a doctoral degree. My ultimate career goal is to become either an astronaut or a flight director. Space travel takes an immense, often over-looked, amount of mental strength, and the stress involved with space exploration (and similar high-stakes operations) can be greatly alleviated by advanced technology. By studying cognitive science, interactions between people and increasingly common computers have the potential to be improved. My fascination with the powerful and beautiful machine that is the human brain, combined with my experience in robotics and astronomy contributes to my excitement about the future of artificial intelligence and highly capable robots.
        I am highly interested in participating in research and internships to gain valuable experience to supplement my education and enable me to learn as much as I can while immersing myself in a rich, vibrant community of like-minded scientists and scholars. From the core curriculum to the work done by the Cognitive Science Lab, I see my career and education goals supported at IU.
        My motivation to investigate human consciousness and worldview stems from my own mental illnesses. In 2015 I was diagnosed with clinical depression/anxiety. For months on end I felt weak and helpless, which put severe tensions on my academic and social lives. Between medications, therapy, and spiritual treatment, the one thing that gave me the strength to push through and rise above my illness was the pursuit of knowledge regarding the human mind, in a mission to better understand myself. Along this journey, I became captivated by the study of consciousness and am eager to learn all that I can so that I may integrate it with my other interests to ultimately contribute to the exploration of the world within and around us.

      <h3>After School</h3>
      <p>Over the past four years, I have joined many clubs and participated in a variety of extracurriculars. I love partaking in the diverse range of clubs offered at our school, and was even inspired to start one myself.</p>
          <p><b>FIRST Robotics Competition - Team 1318, the I.R.S.</b><br>As a member of our highly competitive team, I have spent an extensive amount of time learning a myriad of technical skills (including electronics, pneumatics, mechanical, and programming methods) as well as the business and logistical facets of the engineering process. I have served my team as the secretary (2015-16), director of pneumatics, director of outreach, and the driver of the robot at competitions. Through this team I have formed lifelong friendships and discovered my passion for STEM.</p><br>
          <p><b>Issaquah High School Band</b><br>Issaquah High School band program, producing 2 concerts a year as well as performing at varsity football and basketball games as a marching and pep band.
          From day one, I have proudly called myself a band nerd. My main instrument is piccolo (orchestral piccolo is my favorite), but I can also play the flute, trumpet, alto saxophone, euphonium, and a little bit of piano.
          Music is a huge part of my life, and I feel so lucky to be able to represent and serve my band as a Drum Major. I was chosen by my band director as a sophomore to be the drum major for the class of 2018.
          Aside from conducting and leading the band at football and basketball games, I choreograph baton routines, lead the annual Salmon Days parade, and do whatever else the director asks to make the band run smoother and be a generally better place. I love
          band, and I will always strive to keep it in my life.</p><br>
          <p><b>JSA - Junior States of America</b><br> While I only participated for a year and a half, I thoroughly enjoyed being a member of this debate and politics club. I got to break out of my shell and debate with my peers,
            learn more about the art of arguing, and even participate in a Congress/Senate simulation.</p>
