      <center><p><i> <b>Hello!</b></i><br> I am a first year undergraduate student at Indiana University, Bloomington. My major is <b>Intelligent Systems Engineering, with a concentration
        in cyber physical systems</b> and my minors are <b>mathematics and astronomy/astrophysics</b>. Following my undergraduate studies, I hope to eventually pursue a doctorate degree.
        As a student, I seek every possible opportunity to expand my knowledge on astronomy, robotics, engineering, and scientific research methods and advocacy.
        I hope to contribute to the advancement of science by ultimately becoming an <b>astronaut</b>.

      <h3>After School</h3>
      <p>Over the past four years, I have joined many clubs and participated in a variety of extracurriculars. I love partaking in the diverse range of clubs offered at our school, and was even inspired to start one myself.</p>
          <p><b>FIRST Robotics Competition - Team 1318, the I.R.S.</b><br>As a member of our highly competitive team, I have spent an extensive amount of time learning a myriad of technical skills (including electronics, pneumatics, mechanical, and programming methods) as well as the business and logistical facets of the engineering process. I have served my team as the secretary (2015-16), director of pneumatics, director of outreach, and the driver of the robot at competitions. Through this team I have formed lifelong friendships and discovered my passion for STEM.</p><br>
          <p><b>Issaquah High School Band</b><br>Issaquah High School band program, producing 2 concerts a year as well as performing at varsity football and basketball games as a marching and pep band.
          From day one, I have proudly called myself a band nerd. My main instrument is piccolo (orchestral piccolo is my favorite), but I can also play the flute, trumpet, alto saxophone, euphonium, and a little bit of piano.
          Music is a huge part of my life, and I feel so lucky to be able to represent and serve my band as a Drum Major. I was chosen by my band director as a sophomore to be the drum major for the class of 2018.
          Aside from conducting and leading the band at football and basketball games, I choreograph baton routines, lead the annual Salmon Days parade, and do whatever else the director asks to make the band run smoother and be a generally better place. I love
          band, and I will always strive to keep it in my life.</p><br>
          <p><b>Issaquah Aerospace Initiative</b><br>I participated in a team of 8 students in the Team America Rocketry Challenge competition. We designed, tested, and launched a four foot tall rocket. I served the team as the Materials Director, and
            applied my knowledge from robotics to lead fabrication efforts. Through this project, I learned how much I enjoy the fabrication project, and really developed my knowledge of aerospace engineering and the math and scientific principles that go into it.</p><br>
      <p><b>Astronomy Club</b><br>During my sophomore year, I worked with one of my science teachers to start an astronomy club at our school. As a result of
        scheduling conflicts and administrative issuse, I ended up being the founder and president of a club of 4 (6, on a good day) kids, advised by my U.S. History teacher.
        These conditions were not ideal, but I powered through junior year with the help of a few friends. I delivered short lectures, lead small activities (a fan favorite was when we mimicked the process of crater formation using powdered sugar, pudding, and chocolates).</p>
